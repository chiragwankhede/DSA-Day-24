🌟 Day 24: Mastering 2D Arrays in C++ 🚀

Hey everyone! 👋

Hope you're all having a great day of learning! Today, I delved into 2D arrays with guidance from Love Babbar 👍

📚 What I Did Today:

1. Understanding 2D Arrays
    - Concept: A 2D array is an array of arrays, allowing storage of data in a grid or matrix format.
    - Example: `int arr[3][4];` creates a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns.

2. Row-wise and Column-wise Sum
    - Problem Statement: Calculate the sum of elements in each row and each column of a 2D array.
    - Approach: Used nested loops to iterate through rows and columns, calculating and printing the sums.

3. Finding Minimum and Maximum Numbers in a 2D Array
    - Problem Statement: Identify the smallest and largest elements in a 2D array.
    - Approach: Implemented functions to traverse the array and keep track of the minimum and maximum values.

4. Searching for a Target Element Using Linear Search
    - Problem Statement: Check if a specific target element is present in a 2D array.
    - Approach: Used linear search with nested loops to iterate through the array and determine if the target element exists.

💡 Why This Matters:
Understanding and mastering 2D arrays is essential for efficiently handling data in a grid or matrix format, which is a common requirement in various applications and technical interviews.
